network-canvas
==============

What it is
----------

network-canvas is a reimplementation of github's network graph using HTML5 canvas element instead of flash.

AFAIK, Canvas is supported by chrome, firefox 3+, opera and safari, so unless you are using IE or an old version of these browsers you shouldn't have any problem.

How to use it
-------------

This is currently alpha quality, NOT FOR USE. You've been warned.

First, grab the code, put it in an apache folder, and try accessing index.html. (You will need a server because the data files are loaded through an AJAX request)

This uses only stored data (`network_data` and `network_meta` files) taken from mojombo's jekyll project.
